## Hi thereðŸ‘‹
I'm a passionate software developer who is interested in FinTech and AI. I'm constantly learning and building new things. In my free time, I enjoy working on simple side projects and participating in hackathons to learn new technologies and frameworks.

This profile showcases my projects, skills, and experiences. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
## My skills

### Most notable skills
* [![.NET Applications](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=dotnet,visualstudio,cpp,kotlin)](https://skillicons.dev) : During my internship at the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC), I worked on large scale .NET applications using the .NET Framework and .NET core frameworks. The applications consisted of a web application, a console application, a library and a windows service application. These applications were built using the C++ programming language, HTML, CSS and through the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE. I also worked on a Kotlin Quarkus project during which I used the Test Driven Development methodology to create unit and integration tests using the mockito and quarkus libraries.  
* [![Github actions, CI/CD and AWS](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=githubactions,github,aws)](https://skillicons.dev) : At GIC, I also worked on the Continuous Integration and Continous Development pipeline using Github actions and AWS services. The SAST and Code QL features of Github actions made it easier for me to identify possible security vulnerabilities in the projects I was deploying to either AWS or to remote machines. I utilised the AWS Event bridge, lambda functions, s3 and cloudfront services to deploy a UI application as well as to configure the policies for AWS lambda and event bridge.
* [![React Typescript frontend](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=ts,react,vite,postman)](https://skillicons.dev) : During my interships at Ramco Systems and GIC, I built applications using TypeScript as the programming language and React as the framework. During my internship at Ramco Systems, I worked with an abstract factory design pattern for the backend while during my internship at GIC I used a Singleton design pattern for certain services. I used postman to test REST APIs and to ensure that responses were being passed in appropriate formats.
* [![Node application](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=nodejs,rabbitmq,mongodb)](https://skillicons.dev): During my internship at Ramco Systems, I worked with MQTT, AMQP and Rabbit MQ to transition away from using REST APIs for our web application to use queue systems to manage network traffic instead. The project had a nodejs backend and MongoDB as the database. I also worked on a [tenant/landlord portal](https://github.com/sarang2551/tenantPortal) as part of a module at Singapore University of Technology and Design, that was built using the MERN framework.
* [![Java android app](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=java,androidstudio)](https://skillicons.dev): I worked on an Android app built using Java as the programming language and Android Studio for the IDE. The app was a smart classroom solution that helped interactions between professors, teaching assistants and students.
